This 'md' file is an overview of how to perform non metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using the vegan package with microbiome data originating from a phyloseq object.
If you are interested in more background on how NMDS works, its strengths and weaknesses compared to other ordination methods,
see the following review: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.13536

NMDS is an exploratory analysis. Strong for getting an overall sense of how different two (or more) microbial communities are based on some set of phylogenetic (i.e. rRNA genes) or
functional (metagenomic) datasets. 

First, load the following packages. 
```
library(vegan)
library(phyloseq)
library(tidyverse)
```
